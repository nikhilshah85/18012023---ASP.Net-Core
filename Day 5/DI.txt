			Dependency Injection
		This is more to do with 
			a. Perform of app on server
			b. Lazy Loading of object


	We create a lot of objects, but we never write to code to destroy them
		Because, we know GC will come and do it for us

		Instead, now the trend is, Runtime, will create the object for you 
		and destroy it as per your configuration (3 modes for the same)

		Thus, you will not create object of any class in other class


	1. Create and destroy object For every new call - PerCall
		Transcient Method to be used
		use for dynamic data - eg. StockRate, Temperature
	2. Create a new object for every user and destroy when user goes - PerSession
		Scoped Method to be used
		personal data of user - Banking account
	3. Crete a new object when server starts and destroy it when server stops - Global
		SingleTon
		use for Static data /Common data for every one - eg.Ticket Schedule
