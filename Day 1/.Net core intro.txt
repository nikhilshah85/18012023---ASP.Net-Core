1. What is .Net Core 
	ASP.net Core vs ASP.net framework 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


		ASp.net framework - creates wonderful websites / RAD - Rapid App develoment


			To start a new project with a team of 50 developers

		1. Visual Studio licence - Comes at high cost (40,000) per developer
		2. VS needs Windows OS - buy windows licence as well 
		3. Windows Server - for production (high licence)

-----------------This is a huge cost - initially 
		4. There are lot of challnages with ASP.Net framework - 
			Responsive web apps, problems with master pages, page lifecycle, security
			not based on any design pattern...
		5. Cloud platform 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Against this 
			Node
			Angular, React, bootstrap
				Cross platform, open source, Free
	
			Tools - free - sublime, VIM, etc..
			You also had Java free
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Microsoft had to completely REWRITE the development framework
			Cross platform
			Cloud Support
			VS Code - free and fanstatic tool
			Better app development experience compared to Angular, React, etc...
